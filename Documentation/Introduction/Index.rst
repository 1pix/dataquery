Introduction
------------

The dataquery extension is a Data Provider for the Tesseract
framework. It can be used to query the local TYPO3 database and return
the resulting recordset in a standardized data structure (SDS) of type
"recordset" or "idlist".

It is designed to make it easy to write SQL by automating the handling
of all the TYPO3 standard mechanisms, like enable fields and language
overlays.
