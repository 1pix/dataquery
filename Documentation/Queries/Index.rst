Writing queries
---------------

As is discussed later, there's quite a lot of magic going on behind
the scenes to make the users' lives easier. This comes at some cost:
it is not possible to write queries in any arbitrary way. In effect,
Data Query will accept only a sub-set of SQL commands. It also adds a
few of its own for increased convenience. All the rules that pertain
to writing queries are described in this chapter.

   All keywords must be written in *upper case*, as they
   appear in this manual.
